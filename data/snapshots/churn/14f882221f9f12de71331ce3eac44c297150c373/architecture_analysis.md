1) The commit summary and PlantUML diff indicate a significant architectural change in the software. The most notable change is the removal of the `VisitsAtomView` class and the addition of the `VetsAtomView` class. This suggests a shift in the abstraction level, possibly indicating a change in the way the software handles or presents data related to visits and vets. Another significant change is the shift in the relationship between the `OwnerController` and `ClinicService` and `OwnerRepository`. Previously, `OwnerController` was directly linked to `OwnerRepository`, but now it interacts with `ClinicService`. This suggests a boundary shift, where the `OwnerController` no longer directly interacts with the `OwnerRepository`, but instead goes through the `ClinicService`.

2) The responsibility of the `OwnerController` has been reduced as it no longer directly interacts with the `OwnerRepository`. This change increases the cohesion within the `OwnerController` as it now only needs to interact with the `ClinicService` to perform its functions. The coupling between `OwnerController` and `OwnerRepository` has been removed, which could make the system more flexible and easier to modify in the future. However, this also increases the responsibility of the `ClinicService` as it now acts as the intermediary between the `OwnerController` and the `OwnerRepository`.

3) The potential benefits of these changes include increased modularity and separation of concerns, which can lead to improved maintainability. By reducing the direct dependencies between classes, changes in one class are less likely to affect others, reducing the risk of introducing defects. However, there are also potential risks. The increased responsibility of the `ClinicService` could make it a
