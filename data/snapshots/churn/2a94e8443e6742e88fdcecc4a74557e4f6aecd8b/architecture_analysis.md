1) The commit shows a significant architectural shift from a monolithic structure to a more microservice-oriented architecture. The removal of the `ClinicService` and `ClinicServiceImpl` classes, which previously had relationships with multiple repositories, indicates a move towards a more decoupled design. The addition of service classes like `OwnerService`, `PetService`, `VetService`, and `VisitService` suggests that responsibilities are being distributed among more specialized classes. The addition of application classes like `ClientsServiceApplication`, `ConfigServerApplication`, `DiscoveryServerApplication`, `VetsServiceApplication`, and `VisitsServiceApplication` further supports the shift towards a microservice architecture. 

2) The responsibility shifts are evident in the new relationships formed between the resource classes and the newly added service classes. Previously, resource classes like `OwnerResource`, `PetResource`, and `VetResource` were directly linked to the `ClinicService`. Now, they are linked to their respective service classes, indicating a more direct and cohesive relationship. This change increases the cohesion within the classes as they are now more focused on specific responsibilities. The coupling between classes is also reduced as the dependency on a single service class (`ClinicService`) is eliminated.

3) The shift towards a microservice architecture could potentially increase the maintainability of the system as it allows for independent development and deployment of different services. It also improves scalability as individual services can be scaled based on their specific needs. However, this architectural change also introduces potential risks. The increased number of services can lead to higher complexity in managing inter-service communication and data consistency. It may also increase the potential for defects due to the increased number of interfaces and interactions between services. The removal of the `
