1) The architectural intent of this commit seems to be primarily focused on the removal of the EntityUtils class. This could indicate a shift in the way entities are being handled within the system. The remaining classes and their relationships appear to be unchanged, suggesting that the overall architecture of the system remains largely the same. The removal of EntityUtils might be an attempt to simplify the system or to remove an abstraction that was deemed unnecessary or overly complex.

2) The removal of the EntityUtils class could potentially lead to a shift in responsibilities among the remaining classes. If EntityUtils was previously responsible for certain operations related to entities, those responsibilities would now need to be handled by other classes. This could lead to increased coupling if these responsibilities are not properly distributed among the remaining classes. On the other hand, if EntityUtils was not providing a clear benefit in terms of cohesion, its removal could potentially improve the overall cohesion of the system.

3) The main risk associated with this commit is that the removal of EntityUtils could lead to unforeseen issues if it was previously handling important tasks. This could potentially lead to an increase in defects if these tasks are not properly handled by the remaining classes. On the other hand, the removal of EntityUtils could potentially lead to benefits in terms of simplifying the system and reducing complexity. This could make the system easier to maintain and could potentially reduce the likelihood of defects. However, without more information about the specific responsibilities of EntityUtils, it's difficult to definitively assess the potential risks and benefits of this commit.
