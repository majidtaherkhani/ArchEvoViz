1) The commit summary and PlantUML diff suggest a significant architectural shift in the application. The addition of new classes such as `CrashController`, `JpaPetRepositoryImpl`, `JpaVetRepositoryImpl`, `JpaVisitRepositoryImpl`, `PetTypeFormatter`, `SpringDataPetRepository`, `SpringDataVetRepository`, and `SpringDataVisitRepository` indicates a move towards a more modular and layered architecture. The removal of classes like `AbstractTraceAspect`, `ClinicBindingInitializer`, `JdbcClinicImplMBean`, `JpaClinicImpl`, `PetTypeEditor`, `SpringDataClinic`, `SpringDataOwnerRepository`, and `UsageLogAspect` suggests a shift away from the previous architecture, possibly due to redundancy, inefficiency, or a change in the application's requirements. The new abstractions seem to be focused on improving the separation of concerns and encapsulation in the application.

2) The responsibility shifts are evident in the new relationships formed and the old ones removed. The `PetRepository`, `VetRepository`, and `VisitRepository` interfaces now have new implementations (`SpringDataPetRepository`, `SpringDataVetRepository`, `SpringDataVisitRepository`, `JpaPetRepositoryImpl`, `JpaVetRepositoryImpl`, `JpaVisitRepositoryImpl`), suggesting a shift in data access and management responsibilities. The addition of `PetTypeFormatter` and its relationship with `ClinicService` indicates a new responsibility for formatting pet types. The removal of relationships between `ClinicService` and `ClinicBindingInitializer`, `SpringDataClinic`, `JpaClinicImpl`, and `PetTypeEditor` suggests a reduction in coupling, which
