The commit summary and PlantUML diff suggest a significant architectural shift in the software system. The addition of classes such as `ApiGatewayController`, `CustomersServiceClient`, and `VisitsServiceClient` indicates a move towards a microservices architecture. The removal of classes like `OwnerService`, `PetService`, and `VetService` suggests that the responsibilities of these services have been distributed among the new classes. The addition of `OwnerEntityMapper` and the relationship between `OwnerResource` and `OwnerEntityMapper` suggest a shift towards a more data-centric architecture, possibly to improve data handling and performance.

Responsibility shifts are evident in the removal and addition of relationships. The removal of relationships between `OwnerResource` and `OwnerService`, `PetResource` and `PetService`, and `VetResource` and `VetService` indicates a decoupling of resources and services. This is further supported by the addition of relationships between `ApiGatewayController` and the new service clients. This shift likely improves the system's cohesion by ensuring that each class has a single, well-defined responsibility. The addition of `OwnerEntityMapper` and its relationship with `OwnerResource` suggests a shift in data mapping responsibilities.

The shift towards a microservices architecture could potentially increase the system's scalability and flexibility. However, it also introduces potential risks such as increased complexity and the need for more sophisticated service coordination and data consistency mechanisms. The decoupling of resources and services could improve maintainability by making the system more modular, but it could also increase the risk of defects if the dependencies between classes are not managed properly. The shift in data mapping responsibilities could improve data handling and performance, but it could also introduce new defects if not implemented
