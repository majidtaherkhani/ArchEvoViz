1) The commit shows a significant architectural shift from a monolithic structure to a more modular, repository-based design. The removal of classes like `Clinic`, `AddOwnerForm`, `AddPetForm`, `AddVisitForm`, and their dependencies indicates a move away from a tightly coupled design. The addition of interfaces like `ClinicService`, `OwnerRepository`, `PetRepository`, `VetRepository`, and `VisitRepository` suggests the introduction of new abstractions that promote loose coupling and high cohesion. The addition of classes like `ClinicServiceImpl`, `JdbcOwnerRepositoryImpl`, `JdbcPetRepositoryImpl`, `JdbcVetRepositoryImpl`, and `JdbcVisitRepositoryImpl` indicates the implementation of these interfaces, providing flexibility in terms of data access and manipulation.

2) The responsibility of the `Clinic` class and its related forms has been distributed among the new service and repository classes. This shift increases the cohesion within classes as each class now has a single, well-defined responsibility. The coupling between classes has also been reduced as the new classes interact through interfaces, not concrete implementations. This allows for easier changes in the future as modifications in one class would not require changes in its dependent classes.

3) The shift to a more modular architecture brings several potential benefits. It improves maintainability as each class is now smaller and has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify. It also reduces the risk of defects as changes in one class are less likely to impact others. However, there are also potential risks. The increased number of classes and interfaces could make the system more complex to understand as a whole. Additionally, if the interfaces are not well-designed, it could lead to problems in the future when
