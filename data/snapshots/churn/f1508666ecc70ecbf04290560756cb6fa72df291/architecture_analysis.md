1) The commit summary and PlantUML diff suggest a significant architectural shift in the application. The removal of the `OwnerController` and `VetController` classes and the addition of `OwnerResource` and `VetResource` classes indicate a move towards a more resource-oriented architecture. This is further supported by the introduction of `SpringDataOwnerRepository`, which seems to be a new abstraction for data access, likely leveraging Spring Data's repository pattern. The removal of `VetsAtomView` suggests a change in the way data is presented or consumed, possibly moving away from Atom feeds.

2) The responsibility of interacting with the `ClinicService` has been shifted from the removed `OwnerController` and `VetController` to the newly added `OwnerResource` and `VetResource`. This suggests a change in the way the application handles requests and interacts with the service layer. The addition of `SpringDataOwnerRepository` and its relationship with `OwnerRepository` indicates a shift in data access responsibilities, likely providing a more abstracted, simpler way to perform CRUD operations. The coupling between classes seems to remain relatively consistent, with the new classes maintaining similar relationships to `ClinicService` as the removed ones. However, the cohesion within the system may have improved with the introduction of the Spring Data repository, as it promotes a cleaner, more organized way of handling data access.

3) The shift towards a resource-oriented architecture and the use of Spring Data repositories could potentially increase the maintainability of the application. The resource-oriented approach is often easier to understand and manage, as it aligns closely with RESTful principles. The use of Spring Data repositories can simplify data access code, reducing the chance of errors and making the code
