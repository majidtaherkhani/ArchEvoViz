1) The commit shows a significant architectural shift with the introduction of new abstractions and the removal of existing ones. The addition of classes like `ApiGatewayController`, `CustomersServiceClient`, `VisitsServiceClient`, and `ZipkinServer` suggests a move towards a microservices architecture, with each service having its own client and the API Gateway acting as the single entry point. The removal of classes like `BaseEntity`, `NamedEntity`, `Person`, and service classes like `OwnerService`, `PetService`, `VetService`, and `VisitService` indicates a simplification of the domain model and a shift away from a layered architecture.

2) The responsibility shifts are evident in the changes to the relationships between classes. The resources now directly depend on their respective repositories, instead of going through a service layer. This reduces the level of abstraction and could lead to tighter coupling between the resources and the repositories. However, it also increases cohesion as the resources now directly contain the logic to interact with the repositories. The `ApiGatewayController` now depends on the `CustomersServiceClient` and `VisitsServiceClient`, indicating a shift of responsibilities towards the gateway for coordinating the communication between services.

3) The shift towards a microservices architecture could bring several benefits, such as improved scalability and the ability to deploy and update services independently. However, it also introduces potential risks, such as increased complexity in managing inter-service communication and ensuring data consistency across services. The removal of the service layer could lead to a decrease in maintainability if the resources become too complex, but it could also reduce defects by eliminating a layer where errors could occur. The impact on maintainability will largely depend on how well the responsibilities are divided among the resources and repositories
