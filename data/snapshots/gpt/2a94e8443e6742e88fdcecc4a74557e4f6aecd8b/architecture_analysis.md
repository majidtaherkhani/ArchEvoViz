1) The commit summary and PlantUML diff suggest a significant architectural shift in the application. The removal of the PetClinicApplication class and the addition of five new classes (ClientsServiceApplication, ConfigServerApplication, DiscoveryServerApplication, VetsServiceApplication, VisitsServiceApplication) indicate a move towards a microservices architecture. This is a common strategy to break down a monolithic application into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The removal of relationships between the AbstractResourceController and the resource classes (OwnerResource, PetResource, VetResource, VisitResource) also suggests a decoupling of these components, further supporting the shift towards a microservices architecture.

2) The responsibility shifts are evident in the removal of relationships between the AbstractResourceController and the resource classes. Previously, these classes were likely responsible for handling HTTP requests and delegating tasks to the appropriate services. With the removal of these relationships, it's likely that each new service application class will take on these responsibilities for their respective domain. This change increases the cohesion within each service as they now encapsulate both the business logic and the handling of HTTP requests. However, it also increases the coupling between services as they may need to communicate with each other to fulfill certain requests.

3) The shift towards a microservices architecture has both potential risks and benefits. On the positive side, it can improve maintainability as each service can be developed and deployed independently, allowing for more frequent updates and quicker response to changing requirements. It can also improve scalability as each service can be scaled independently based on demand. However, this architecture also introduces new complexities such as inter-service communication, data consistency, and distributed system coordination. These complexities can increase the risk of
