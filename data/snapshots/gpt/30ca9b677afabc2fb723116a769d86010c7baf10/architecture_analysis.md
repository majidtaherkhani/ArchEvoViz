1) The commit introduces new abstractions and shifts in the architectural boundaries. The addition of the `ApiGatewayApplication`, `Monitored`, `MonitoringConfig`, and `VetsProperties` classes suggests a move towards a more modular and microservice-oriented architecture. The `ApiGatewayApplication` class could be a new entry point for API requests, while the `Monitored` and `MonitoringConfig` classes hint at an increased focus on application monitoring. The `VetsProperties` class could be a configuration class for the Vets service. The removal of the `AbstractResourceController` and `PetclinicProperties` classes indicates a shift away from a monolithic architecture.

2) The addition of the `VetsProperties` class and its relationship with the `CacheConfig` class suggests a shift in responsibilities related to caching. This could lead to increased cohesion within the `CacheConfig` class as it now only needs to interact with the `VetsProperties` class for caching-related configurations. However, this also introduces a new coupling between the `CacheConfig` and `VetsProperties` classes. The removal of the `AbstractResourceController` class could also lead to a shift in responsibilities among the remaining classes.

3) The shift towards a more modular and microservice-oriented architecture could potentially increase the maintainability of the system by making it easier to understand, test, and modify individual components. However, it could also introduce new risks related to inter-service communication and data consistency. The increased focus on application monitoring could help in early detection and resolution of issues, thereby reducing the number of defects. However, the new coupling between the `CacheConfig` and `VetsProperties` classes could potentially increase the risk of defects if changes in one class are
