1) The commit summary and PlantUML diff suggest a significant architectural shift in the software. The removal of a large number of classes, particularly those prefixed with 'Jdbc' and 'Jpa', indicates a move away from a specific database technology or a change in the persistence layer. The addition of 'PetClinicApplication' and 'PetResource' classes suggests the introduction of a new abstraction layer, possibly for better separation of concerns or to facilitate a microservices architecture. The removal of relationships between repositories and other classes also suggests a boundary shift, possibly towards a more decoupled architecture.

2) The responsibility of the removed classes seems to have been shifted to the 'ClinicService' and its implementation 'ClinicServiceImpl'. This is evident from the new relationship between 'PetResource' and 'ClinicService'. This shift could lead to higher cohesion within the new classes as they are more focused on their responsibilities. However, it could also lead to higher coupling if 'ClinicService' becomes a monolithic class with too many responsibilities. The removal of the 'PetController' and 'PetTypeFormatter' classes and their relationships with 'ClinicService' also suggests a shift in the handling of pet-related operations.

3) The architectural changes could potentially improve maintainability by reducing the complexity of the codebase and making it easier to understand and modify. However, there are also risks associated with such a significant change. The removal of a large number of classes could lead to loss of functionality if not properly managed. The shift in responsibilities could also introduce new defects if the new classes do not correctly implement the responsibilities of the removed classes. The impact on performance should also be considered, as the new architecture could introduce additional overhead. Overall,
