1) The architectural intent of this commit seems to be a shift towards a more modular and service-oriented architecture. The ClinicService and ClinicServiceImpl classes have been removed, and in their place, several new service classes have been added: OwnerService, PetService, VetService, and VisitService. These new classes appear to be more specific and focused than the previous ClinicService, suggesting a move towards a more granular division of responsibilities. Additionally, an AbstractResourceController class has been added, which the OwnerResource, PetResource, VetResource, and VisitResource classes now extend. This suggests an attempt to abstract common functionality into a superclass, reducing code duplication and increasing maintainability.

2) The responsibility shifts are evident in the new relationships between classes. Previously, the ClinicService was responsible for interacting with the OwnerRepository, PetRepository, VetRepository, and VisitRepository. Now, these responsibilities have been distributed among the new service classes. This change increases the cohesion within each service class, as each one is now more focused on a specific area of functionality. However, it also increases the coupling between the resource classes and the new service classes, as each resource class now depends on multiple service classes.

3) The potential benefits of these changes include increased maintainability and reduced defect density. By dividing responsibilities among more classes, each class becomes simpler and easier to understand, which can reduce the likelihood of defects. The use of an abstract superclass for the resource classes can also reduce code duplication, another common source of defects. However, there are also potential risks. The increased coupling between classes could make the system more fragile, as changes in one class could now potentially affect more other classes. Additionally, the increased number of classes could make the system more complex and harder
