1) The architectural intent of this commit seems to be a refactoring of the application's structure to improve modularity and separation of concerns. The `VisitController` class has been removed and replaced with the `VisitResource` class, indicating a shift from a controller-based architecture to a resource-based one. This could be an attempt to align the application with RESTful principles, which emphasize resources over controllers. Additionally, two new classes, `CacheConfig` and `WebConfig`, have been added. These classes likely represent configurations for caching and web settings, respectively, suggesting an intent to externalize configuration from the main application code.

2) The responsibility of managing the `ClinicService` has been shifted from the `VisitController` to the `VisitResource`. This change increases the coupling between the `VisitResource` and `ClinicService`, but it may also improve cohesion if the `VisitResource` is now more focused on managing visits. The removal of the `VisitController` class also reduces the overall complexity of the system, as there is now one less class to maintain.

3) The shift to a resource-based architecture could potentially improve the maintainability of the application by making it easier to understand and modify. However, it could also introduce new defects if the transition was not handled correctly. For example, if the `VisitResource` does not fully replicate the functionality of the `VisitController`, some features may no longer work as expected. The addition of the `CacheConfig` and `WebConfig` classes could also introduce risks if they are not properly configured. On the other hand, if they are used effectively, they could improve the performance and flexibility of the application. Overall, the impact of these changes on maintainability and defects
