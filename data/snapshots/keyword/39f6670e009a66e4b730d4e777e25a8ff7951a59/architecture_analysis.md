1) The commit shows a significant architectural shift with the introduction of new abstractions and the removal of several classes. The addition of classes like `ApiGatewayController`, `CustomersServiceClient`, `VisitsServiceClient`, and `OwnerEntityMapper` suggests a move towards a microservices architecture. The `ApiGatewayController` class, in particular, indicates the use of an API Gateway pattern, which is common in microservices architectures. The removal of service classes like `OwnerService`, `PetService`, `VetService`, and `VisitService` suggests a shift in the boundary of responsibilities, possibly moving the business logic from these services to the new client classes and controllers.

2) The responsibility shifts are evident in the changes in relationships between classes. The `OwnerResource`, `PetResource`, `VetResource`, and `VisitResource` classes are now directly linked to their respective repositories, indicating a shift in data access responsibilities. The addition of `OwnerEntityMapper` suggests a new layer of abstraction for data mapping. The coupling between classes has also changed, with the `ApiGatewayController` now coupled with the `CustomersServiceClient` and `VisitsServiceClient`. This could lead to higher cohesion within the new classes as they are more focused on specific responsibilities.

3) The shift towards a microservices architecture could bring several benefits, including improved scalability, fault isolation, and the ability to use different technologies for different services. However, it also introduces potential risks such as increased complexity in managing services and data consistency. The removal of service classes could lead to a reduction in defects related to these classes, but the new classes need to be thoroughly tested to ensure they function as expected. The maintainability of the system could be improved due to
