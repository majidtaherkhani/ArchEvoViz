1) The architectural intent of this commit is to introduce a new abstraction, the `SpringDataOwnerRepository` class, into the system. This class is an implementation of the `OwnerRepository` interface, which suggests that it provides a way to interact with owner data using Spring Data. This addition represents a boundary shift as it introduces a new way of accessing and manipulating owner data, potentially offering more flexibility or efficiency. No classes or relationships were removed in this commit, indicating that the existing architecture was extended rather than modified.

2) The addition of the `SpringDataOwnerRepository` class suggests a shift in responsibilities for handling owner data. Previously, this responsibility was shared between `JdbcOwnerRepositoryImpl` and `JpaOwnerRepositoryImpl`, both of which implement the `OwnerRepository` interface. With the introduction of `SpringDataOwnerRepository`, there is now another class that can handle these responsibilities. This could lead to a change in coupling and cohesion, as the `ClinicServiceImpl` class, which depends on the `OwnerRepository` interface, now has another potential implementation to interact with. This could increase coupling if `ClinicServiceImpl` needs to be aware of which implementation it is using, but could also improve cohesion if the new class allows for more specialized or efficient handling of owner data.

3) The potential benefits of this change include increased flexibility and efficiency in handling owner data, as Spring Data provides powerful features for data access and manipulation. This could lead to improved performance and maintainability, as developers can leverage Spring Data's features instead of writing custom data access code. However, there are also potential risks. Introducing a new way of accessing data could lead to inconsistencies if the different implementations are not kept in sync. Additionally, if
