1) The commit summary and PlantUML diff suggest a significant architectural shift in the software. The removal of classes such as `ClinicService`, `ClinicServiceImpl`, and various `Jdbc` and `Jpa` classes, and the addition of classes like `ApiGatewayApplication`, `CacheConfig`, `OwnerResource`, `OwnerService`, and others, indicate a move from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. The new classes represent different services in the microservices architecture, each with its own responsibility. The `ApiGatewayApplication` class could be the entry point for client requests, while the `ConfigServerApplication` and `DiscoveryServerApplication` classes could be for configuration and service discovery, respectively. The `Resource` and `Service` classes could be for handling HTTP requests and business logic, respectively.

2) The responsibility shifts are evident from the removal and addition of relationships. The `ClinicServiceImpl` class, which was previously coupled with the `OwnerRepository`, `PetRepository`, `VetRepository`, and `VisitRepository` classes, has been removed. Instead, the new `Service` classes are now coupled with the corresponding `Repository` classes. This suggests a shift towards a more modular and decoupled design, where each service is responsible for its own domain and interacts with the database through its own repository. The cohesion within each service is likely to be high, as each service is focused on a specific function.

3) The shift to a microservices architecture could bring several benefits, such as improved scalability, fault isolation, and the ability to use different technologies for different services. However, it also comes with potential risks and challenges, such as increased complexity in managing and coordinating services, data consistency issues
