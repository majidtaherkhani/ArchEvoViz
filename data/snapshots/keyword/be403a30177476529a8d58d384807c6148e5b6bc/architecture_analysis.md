1) The architectural intent of this commit seems to be a shift in the abstraction level and responsibilities of the `OwnerController` class. The `VisitsAtomView` class has been removed and replaced with the `VetsAtomView` class. This suggests a change in the way the application is handling data related to visits and vets. The `OwnerController` class has also undergone a significant change in its relationships. It no longer has a direct relationship with the `OwnerRepository` and instead now has a relationship with the `ClinicService`. This indicates a boundary shift where the `OwnerController` is no longer directly interacting with the repository layer and is instead interacting with the service layer.

2) The responsibility of accessing the `OwnerRepository` has been shifted from the `OwnerController` to the `ClinicService`. This change increases the cohesion within the `OwnerController` as it is now less concerned with the data access logic and can focus more on its primary responsibilities. The coupling between the `OwnerController` and `OwnerRepository` has been removed, which can make the system more flexible and easier to change in the future. However, this also increases the coupling between the `OwnerController` and `ClinicService`.

3) The potential benefits of these changes include a cleaner separation of concerns and increased modularity, which can lead to improved maintainability. By having the `OwnerController` interact with the `ClinicService` instead of the `OwnerRepository`, the system is better aligned with the common architectural pattern of controllers interacting with services, which in turn interact with repositories. This can make the system easier to understand for developers who are familiar with this pattern. However, the potential risks include increased complexity in the `Clinic
