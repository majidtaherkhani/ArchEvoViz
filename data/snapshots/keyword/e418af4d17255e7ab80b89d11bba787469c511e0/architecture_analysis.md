The commit summary and PlantUML diff indicate a significant change in the software architecture. The architectural intent seems to be a shift in the system's boundary, with the removal of the 'ClientsServiceApplication' class and the addition of the 'CustomersServiceApplication' class. This change suggests a possible renaming or refactoring of the client management component of the system, possibly to better align with the business domain or to improve the system's organization and clarity.

In terms of responsibility shifts and coupling/cohesion changes, the removal of 'ClientsServiceApplication' and the addition of 'CustomersServiceApplication' could imply a transfer of responsibilities between these components. However, without further details on the functionality of these classes, it's hard to determine the exact nature of this shift. The relationships between classes remain unchanged, suggesting that the overall structure and coupling of the system remain stable. The unchanged classes and relationships suggest a high level of cohesion within the system, with each class and its methods likely focusing on a single responsibility.

The potential risks associated with this commit include possible issues with data migration or compatibility if the 'CustomersServiceApplication' class does not fully replicate or improve upon the functionality of the 'ClientsServiceApplication' class. There could also be potential risks if other parts of the system are tightly coupled with the removed class and have not been adequately updated to interact with the new class. On the other hand, the benefits could include improved clarity and organization of the system, and potentially enhanced functionality if the new class represents an upgrade or refinement.

In terms of maintainability, if the new 'CustomersServiceApplication' class is well-designed and follows good coding practices, it could potentially improve the maintainability of the system by making it easier to understand and modify. However, if
